The type infrastructure, eg. RootType and the Data classes, are only as
portable as the Binary and Typeable instances.  The latter in particular
is not terribly portable (it is even brittle under some innocuous
refactorings).  

I can't think of any *provable* way to solve this, nor any fully
distributed way.  But a decent solution would be to add a member to
Data:

class Data a where
    desc :: DataDesc a
    version :: String

With the requirement that two types with the same version are serial
compatible (versions should also be unique across types).  Thus if you
make a change to the Binary representation, you are responsible for
updating the version.

There are a couple challenges:

* For existing modules, if we define version on their behalf, we will
  have a hard time keeping up with updates.  That is, the dependencies
  of the package that defines these have to be pretty strict.
* For new modules, making sure that there are no name collisions.

There may be a better solution assuming an Udon package manager though 
(since we can reference modules and ranges of modules directly).

============================

A better format, perhaps, would be to have a standard way to talk about
the direct references of a data structure.  That is, looking at some
unknown blob of data, we can still tell which parts of it are references,
so that we can GC them and communicate them when cloning.

Maybe an indexed dictionary out front like:

    HASH 0 HASH 0 HASH 1 data

And then references refer to that dictionary.
